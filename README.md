## Create your own pre-sets


To create a pre-set, you will have to:

- create a preset file on the `scripts/presetsUtils/presets/` folder
- import the pre-set and add to the `scripts/presetsUtils/presets.js` file

### 1. Create a preset file:

create a JS file in the `scripts/presetsUtils/presets/` folder folowing the structure:

```js
// the BLOCKS variable contains the path to images
// the CELL_SELECTOR variable contains the selectors to the grid, it's pretty intuitive, you can give a look at the file to more details
import { BLOCKS, CELL_SELECTOR } from '../../constants.js';


// Give a simple name to the preset, that name also will be the CODE
const marioBlockBrick = {
    name: "mario block - brick", // the displayName of the pre-set
    code: "marioBlockBrick",

    // here's the definition of the preset, its a list of objects
    blocks: [
        {
            selector: CELL_SELECTOR.LINE_1,
            image: BLOCKS.MARIOBLOCK_BRICK,
        },
        {
            selector: CELL_SELECTOR.LINE_2,
            image: BLOCKS.DASHLINE,
            color: '#9c4a00'
        },
        {
            selector: CELL_SELECTOR.LINE_3,
            image: BLOCKS.MARIOBLOCK_BRICK,
        },
        {
            selector: CELL_SELECTOR.LINE_4,
            image: BLOCKS.DASHLINE,
            color: '#9c4a00'
        },
        {
            selector: CELL_SELECTOR.LINE_5,
            image: BLOCKS.MARIOBLOCK_BRICK,
        }
    ]
}

export default marioBlockBrick;
```

Block Object definition:

```js
{
    // Use the CELL_SELECTOR const
    // you can select all cells, a specific line or cell
    // Obrigatory
    selector: CELL_SELECTOR.LINE_1,

    // use the BLOCKS const, it contains the file's path
    // If you want to add a new image, you'll have to change the constants.js file
    // Optional
    image: BLOCKS.MARIOBLOCK_BRICK,

    // Use HEX colors
    // If you don't know the colors, use any tool online to convert color to HEX
    // can be used with images, if an image has transparent background, the color will appear behind
    // Optional
    color: '#9c4a00'
}

```

### 1.5 Add a new image if is needed

If you want to add an image to you preset that is not include on the project, do the folowing:

- add the image in the `assets/blocks/` folder
- create a path to the image in the `scripts/constants.js` file, on the `BLOCKS` variable:

`scripts/constants.js` :
```js
export const BLOCKS_PATH = './assets/blocks/';

export const BLOCKS = {
    DASHLINE: `${BLOCKS_PATH}dashline.png`,
    MARIOBLOCK_BRICK: `${BLOCKS_PATH}marioBlock-brick.png`,
    MARIOBLOCK_GROUND: `${BLOCKS_PATH}marioBlock-ground.png`,

    // add your image at the end like this:
    MY_IMAGE: `${BLOCKS_PATH}my-image.png`,
}
```

âš  **Tips for choosing an image:**
- Use squares images
- Choose a big size, like 512px x 512px
- A good site is: [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net)
- You can find sprites too in :  [spriters-resource.com](https://www.spriters-resource.com/) and  [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/)

### 2. Import the file

import the pre-set and add to the `scripts/presetsUtils/presets.js` file:

```js
import marioBlockBrick from "./presets/marioBlockBrick.js";
import marioBlockGround from "./presets/marioBlockGround.js";

// import your pre-set file
import myPreset from "./presets/myPreset.js";

const presetList = [
    marioBlockBrick,
    marioBlockGround,

    // add to this list
    myPreset
];

export default presetList;
```
